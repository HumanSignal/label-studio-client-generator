title: Assign Users to Tasks
---

In this tutorial, you will assign a user to portion of tasks in a project filtered by Inner ID (0..100). 

You can also find this as a [Python script in the SDK repo](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/tutorials/assign_users_to_tasks.py). 

<Note>
This example only applies to Label Studio Enterprise and Starter Cloud. Label Studio Community does not have task assignments. 
</Note>

## From the Label Studio UI

1. Go to your project, select **Settings > Annotation > Distribute Labeling Tasks** and ensure your project is in **Manual** mode. 

2. From the **Members** page of your project or workspace, ensure that your user is added as a member. 

3. Run the script: `python assign_users_to_tasks.py <PROJECT_ID> <USER_EMAIL> [AN|RE]`

    * You can find your project ID in the URL when viewing a Label Studio project (e.g. `https://app.humansignal.com/projects/<PROJECT_ID>`) or you can [use the API](../../api-reference/api-reference/projects/list).
    * `AN` - annotator, `RE` - reviewer

In this example, you begin by setting your API key and Label Studio URL as environment variables:

```bash
export LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY="YOUR_TOKEN"
export LABEL_STUDIO_URL="URL"
```

For information on finding your API key and base URL, see [Authenticate and Connect to the API](../../api-reference/introduction/getting-started#authenticate-and-connect-to-the-api).

If you would prefer to set them directly in the script, see the other tutorials for an example. 

## Script

```py
import os
import sys
from label_studio_sdk import LabelStudio


def main():
    # Required: set env vars or pass args
    base_url = os.getenv("LABEL_STUDIO_URL")
    api_key = os.getenv("LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY")
    if not api_key or not base_url:
        print("ERROR: set LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY and LABEL_STUDIO_URL env var")
        sys.exit(1)

    if len(sys.argv) < 3:
        print("Usage: script.py <PROJECT_ID> <USER_EMAIL> [AN|RE]")
        sys.exit(1)

    project_id = int(sys.argv[1])
    user_email = sys.argv[2].strip()
    assignment_type = (
        sys.argv[3].strip().upper() if len(sys.argv) > 3 else "AN"
    )  # AN=annotate, RE=review

    client = LabelStudio(base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key)

    # 1) Get project by ID
    project = client.projects.get(id=project_id)
    print(f"Project: {project.title} (id={project.id})")

    # 2) Get user by email
    users = list(client.users.list())
    user = next(
        (u for u in users if (u.email or "").lower() == user_email.lower()), None
    )
    if not user:
        print(f"ERROR: user with email {user_email} not found")
        sys.exit(1)
    print(f"User: {user.email} (id={user.id})")

    # 3) Assign this user to tasks filtered by Inner ID from 0 to 100 (portion of tasks)
    # Use Data Manager-style filters and select all filtered tasks
    filters = {
        "conjunction": "and",
        "items": [
            {
                "filter": "filter:tasks:inner_id",
                "operator": "greater",
                "value": 0,
                "child_filter": None,
                "type": "Number",
            },
            {
                "filter": "filter:tasks:inner_id",
                "operator": "less",
                "value": 100,
                "child_filter": None,
                "type": "Number",
            },
        ],
    }
    selected_items = {"all": True}

    resp = client.projects.assignments.bulk_assign(
        id=project_id,
        type=assignment_type,  # 'AN' or 'RE'
        users=[user.id],  # list of user IDs
        selected_items=selected_items,  # apply to all tasks matching filters, or you can pass here specific task IDs
        filters=filters,  # Inner ID in (0, 100)
    )

    # Simple summary
    print(f"Bulk assignment done: {resp}")
