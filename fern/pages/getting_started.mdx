<Note>
Version 2.0 of the Label Studio SDK is here, and it's packed with more functionality and a smoother developer experience! 

If you're using an older version, please review the [breaking changes](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk/releases/tag/2.0.0) before upgrading. 
</Note>

You can use the Label Studio Python SDK to make annotating data a more integrated part of your data science and machine learning pipelines. This software development kit (SDK) lets you call the Label Studio API directly from scripts using predefined classes and methods.

<Tip>For additional guidance on using our SDK, see [5 Tips and Tricks for Label Studioâ€™s API and SDK](https://labelstud.io/blog/5-tips-and-tricks-for-label-studio-s-api-and-sdk/)</Tip>

The following are basic examples. For more advanced examples, see [Tutorials](/tutorials).

## Install

Install the Label Studio SDK using pip:
```
pip install label-studio-sdk
```
or
```
poetry add label-studio-sdk
```


## Authenticate and Connect to the API

In your Python scripts, you will need to do the following:

- Import the SDK.
- **Define your Label Studio URL.** 

    For example, `http://localhost:8080` or `https://app.humansignal.com`

    Note:
     - Do not including a trailing slash in your URL
     - `LABEL_STUDIO_URL` should start with `https://` or `http://`
- **Define your API key.** 

    This should be available on the **Account & Settings** page, but you may need to enable it at the organization level first. See [Access tokens](https://labelstud.io/guide/access_tokens).

    You can use either the Legacy Token or the Personal Access Token, but for the SDK we recommend the Personal Access Token. 
- Connect to the API.

Try this example:

```python
# Define the URL where Label Studio is accessible
LABEL_STUDIO_URL = 'YOUR_BASE_URL'
# API key is available at the Account & Settings page in Label Studio UI
LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Import the SDK and the client module
from label_studio_sdk import LabelStudio

# Connect to the Label Studio API 
client = LabelStudio(base_url=LABEL_STUDIO_URL, api_key=LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY)

# A basic request to verify connection is working
me = client.users.whoami()

print("username:", me.username)
print("email:", me.email)
```
<Tip>
You can set `LABEL_STUDIO_URL` and `LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY` as environment variables: 

```bash
export LABEL_STUDIO_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export LABEL_STUDIO_URL="YOUR_BASE_URL"
```
</Tip>

## SDK versions and compatibility

 SDK version &lt; 1 is deprecated and no longer supported. We recommend upgrading to [the latest version](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk).

If you still want to use the older version, you can install it using `pip install "label-studio-sdk<1"`.

You can also check out an older branch version in the GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk.git
cd label-studio-sdk
git fetch origin
git checkout release/0.0.34
```

Or you can simply modify you code to change the import stream as follows:

```python
from label_studio_sdk import Client
from label_studio_sdk.data_manager import Filters, Column, Operator, Type
from label_studio_sdk._legacy import Project
```

If you're looking for the documentation for the older version, you can find it [here](https://labelstud.io/sdk/).

## Advanced

### Handling Errors

If you encounter an error while using the Label Studio Python SDK, you can catch the error and handle it in your script.

```python
from label_studio_sdk.core.api_error import ApiError

try:
    for annotated_task in annotated_tasks:
        print(annotated_task.annotations)
except ApiError as e:
    print(e)
```

Annotations are exported in the format specified in the [Label Studio JSON format](tasks.html#Basic-Label-Studio-JSON-format).

### Timeouts
By default, requests time out after 5 seconds. You can configure this with a timeout option at the client or request level.

```python
from label_studio_sdk import LabelStudio

client = LabelStudio(
    # All timeouts set to 20 seconds
    timeout=20
)

ls.projects.create(..., request_options={
    # Override timeout for a specific method
    'timeout_in_seconds': 20
})
```

### Custom HTTP client

You can override the httpx client to customize it for your use case. Some common use cases
include support for proxies and transports.

```python
custom_httpx_client = httpx.Client(
    transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(
        proxy="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        local_address="0.0.0.0"
    )
)
client = LabelStudio(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    base_url="YOUR_LABEL_STUDIO_URL",
    httpx_client=custom_httpx_client,
)
```
