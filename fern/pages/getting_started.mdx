You can use the Label Studio Python SDK to make annotating data a more integrated part of your data science and machine learning pipelines. This software development kit (SDK) lets you call the Label Studio API directly from scripts using predefined classes and methods.

With the Label Studio Python SDK, you can perform the following tasks in a Python script:
- [Authenticate to the Label Studio API](#connect-to-the-label-studio-api)
- [Create a Label Studio project](#create-a-project), including setting up a labeling configuration.
- [Import tasks](#import-tasks).
- [Manage pre-annotated tasks and model predictions](#add-model-predictions).
- [Connect to a cloud storage provider](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/annotate_data_from_gcs/annotate_data_from_gcs.ipynb), such as Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Services (GCS), to retrieve unlabeled tasks and store annotated tasks.
- [Manage labeling jobs](#managing-labeling-jobs) by creating custom filters and ordering for tasks based on parameters that you specify.
- [Export annotations](#export-annotations) from Label Studio.

<Tip>For additional guidance on using our SDK, see [5 Tips and Tricks for Label Studioâ€™s API and SDK](https://labelstud.io/blog/5-tips-and-tricks-for-label-studio-s-api-and-sdk/)</Tip>

## Install

Install the Label Studio SDK using pip:
```
pip install label-studio-sdk
```
or
```
poetry add label-studio-sdk
```


## Authentication
In your Python script, do the following:

- Import the SDK.
- Define your API key and Label Studio URL (API key is available at _Account_ page).
- Connect to the API.

```python
# Define the URL where Label Studio is accessible and the API key for your user account
LABEL_STUDIO_URL = 'http://localhost:8080'
API_KEY = 'd6f8a2622d39e9d89ff0dfef1a80ad877f4ee9e3'

# Import the SDK and the client module
from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

# Connect to the Label Studio API and check the connection
ls = LabelStudio(base_url=LABEL_STUDIO_URL, api_key=API_KEY)
```

## Create a Project

After you [connect to the Label Studio API](#Connect-to-the-Label-Studio-API), you can create a project in Label Studio using the SDK.
Specify the project title and the labeling configuration. Choose your labeling configuration based on the type of labeling that you wish to perform. See the available [templates for Label Studio projects](https://labelstud.io/templates), or set a blank configuration with `<View></View>`.

For example, create a text classification project in your Python code:
```python
project = ls.projects.create(
    title='Text Classification',
    label_config='''
    <View>
        <Text name="text" value="$text" />
        <Choices name="label" toName="text" choice="single">
            <Choice value="Positive" />
            <Choice value="Negative" />
        </Choices>
    </View>'''
)
```

For more about what you can do with the project module of the SDK, see the [project module SDK reference](https://labelstud.io/sdk/project.html).

## Import Tasks

You can import tasks from your script using the [Label Studio Python SDK client](#Connect-to-the-Label-Studio-API).

[For a specific project created](#Create-a-project), you can import tasks in [Label Studio JSON format](tasks.html#Basic-Label-Studio-JSON-format) or [connect to cloud storage providers](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/annotate_data_from_gcs/annotate_data_from_gcs.ipynb) and import image, audio, or video files directly.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create a single task">
    You can import a single labeling task into [Label Studio project](#Create-a-project):

    ```python
    ls.tasks.create(
        project=project.id,
        data={'text': 'Hello world'}
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create multiple tasks">
    To create multiple tasks at once in a project, use the method:

  ```python
  ls.projects.import_tasks(
      id=project.id,
      request=[
          {"text": "Hello world"},
          {"text": "Hello Label Studio"},
          {"text": "What a beautiful day"},
      ]
  )
  ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create multiple tasks with preannotations">

    You can also import predictions together with tasks as pre-annotated tasks. The SDK offers several ways that you can import pre-annotations into Label Studio.

    One way is to import tasks in a simple JSON format, where one key in the JSON identifies the data object being labeled, and the other is the key containing the prediction.

    In this example, import predictions for an image classification task:
    ```python
    ls.projects.import_tasks(
        id=project.id,
        request=[
            {"text": "Hello world", "sentiment": "Positive"},
            {"text": "Goodbye Label Studio", "sentiment": "Negative"},
            {"text": "What a beautiful day", "sentiment": "Positive"},
        ],
        preannotated_from_fields=['sentiment']
    )
    ```

    Read more about importing pre-annotations in the [Label Studio SDK documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/predictions).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Add Model Predictions

You can add predictions to existing tasks in Label Studio in your Python script.

For an existing simple image classification project, you can do the following to add predictions of "Dog" for image tasks that you retrieve:
```python
tasks = ls.tasks.list(project=project.id, include='id')
for task in tasks:
    ls.predictions.create(
        task=task.id,
        result=[{'from_name': 'label', 'to_name': 'text', 'type': 'choices', 'value': {'choices': ['Positive']}}],
        score=0.99,
        model_version='my-super-ai'
    )
```

For another example, see the [Jupyter notebook example of importing pre-annotated data](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/import_preannotations/import_preannotations.ipynb).

The image is specified in the `image` key using a public URL, and the prediction is referenced in an arbitrary `pet` key, which is then specified in the `preannotated_from_fields()` method.

For more examples, see the [Jupyter notebook example of importing pre-annotated data](https://github.com/heartexlabs/label-studio-sdk/blob/master/examples/import_preannotations/import_preannotations.ipynb).

## Managing Labeling Jobs

You can also use the SDK to control how tasks appear in the data manager to annotators or reviewers. You can create custom filters and ordering for the tasks based on parameters that you specify with the SDK. This lets you have more granular control over which tasks in your dataset get labeled or reviewed, and in which order.

### Create a batch of tasks to annotate

For example, you can create a filter to prepare tasks to be annotated. For example, if you want annotators to focus on tasks in the first 1000 tasks in a dataset that contain the word "possum" in the field "text" in the task data, do the following:
```python
from label_studio_sdk.data_manager import Filters, Column, Type, Operator

filters = Filters.create(Filters.AND, [
    Filters.item(
        Column.id,
        Operator.GREATER_OR_EQUAL,
        Type.Number,
        Filters.value(1)
    ),
        Filters.item(
        Column.id,
        Operator.LESS_OR_EQUAL,
        Type.Number,
        Filters.value(1000)
    ),
    Filters.item(
        Column.data("text"),
        Operator.CONTAINS,
        Type.String,
        Filters.value("Hello")
    )
])
```

For example, to create a filter that displays only tasks with an ID greater than 42 or that were annotated between November 1, 2021, and now, do the following:
```python
from label_studio_sdk.data_manager import Filters, Column, Type, Operator

filters = Filters.create(Filters.OR, [
    Filters.item(
        Column.id,
        Operator.GREATER,
        Type.Number,
        Filters.value(42)
    ),
    Filters.item(
        Column.completed_at,
        Operator.IN,
        Type.Datetime,
        Filters.value(
            datetime(2021, 11, 1),
            datetime.now()
        )
    )
])
```

Now you can create a view with the filter you created:

```python
view = ls.views.create(
    project=project.id,
    data={
        'title': 'New tasks to annotate',
        'filters': filters
    }
)
tab = ls.views.get(id=view.id)
```
If will be displayed in the data manager as tab with `New tasks to annotate` name.

You can use this example filter to prepare completed tasks for review in Label Studio Enterprise.


## Export Annotations

Run the following code to export annotations from project's [batch view you created in the previous step](#Create-batch-of-tasks-to-annotate):

```python
tasks = ls.tasks.list(view=tab.id, fields='all')
for task in tasks:
    # You can access annotations in Label Studio JSON format
    print(task.annotations)
    # And also annotation drafts and predictions
    print(task.predictions)
    print(task.drafts)
```

Read more about export formats in the [Label Studio SDK documentation](https://labelstud.io/guide/export).

## Advanced

### Handling Errors

If you encounter an error while using the Label Studio Python SDK, you can catch the error and handle it in your script.

```python
from label_studio_sdk.core.api_error import ApiError

try:
    for annotated_task in annotated_tasks:
        print(annotated_task.annotations)
except ApiError as e:
    print(e)
```

Annotations are exported in the format specified in the [Label Studio JSON format](tasks.html#Basic-Label-Studio-JSON-format).

### Timeouts
By default, requests time out after 60 seconds. You can configure this with a 
timeout option at the client or request level.

```python
from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

ls = LabelStudio(
    # All timeouts set to 20 seconds
    timeout=20.0
)

ls.projects.create(..., {
    # Override timeout for a specific method
    timeout=20.0
})
```

### Custom HTTP client
You can override the httpx client to customize it for your use-case. Some common use-cases 
include support for proxies and transports.

```python
import httpx

from label_studio_sdk.client import LabelStudio

ls = LabelStudio(
    http_client=httpx.Client(
        proxies="http://my.test.proxy.example.com",
        transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(local_address="0.0.0.0"),
    ),
)
```
