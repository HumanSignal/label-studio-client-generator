        To perform most tasks with the Label Studio API, you must specify the project ID, sometimes referred to as the `pk`. The project ID can be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can retrieve all project IDs using this API call. 


        To retrieve a list of your Label Studio projects, update the following command to match your own environment.

        Replace the domain name, port, and authorization token, then run the following from the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET https://localhost:8080/api/projects/ -H 'Authorization: Token abc123'

  "/api/projects/{id}/import":
    post:
      summary: Import tasks
      description: >
        
        Use this API endpoint to import labeling tasks in bulk. Note that each POST request is limited at 250K tasks and 200 MB.

        The project ID can be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can retrieve all project IDs using [List all projects](list). 


        <Note>
        
        Imported data is verified against a project *label_config* and must include all variables that were used in the *label_config*. 
        
        
        For example, if the label configuration has a *$text* variable, then each item in a data object must include a `text` field.

        </Note>


        There are three possible ways to import tasks with this endpoint:


        #### 1\. **POST with data**

        Send JSON tasks as POST data. Only JSON is supported for POSTing files directly.


        Update this example to specify your authorization token and Label Studio instance host, then run the following from

        the command line:


        ```bash

        curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' \

        -X POST 'https://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/import' --data '[{"text": "Some text 1"}, {"text": "Some text 2"}]'

        ```


        #### 2\. **POST with files**

        Send tasks as files. You can attach multiple files with different names.


        - **JSON**: text files in JavaScript object notation format

        - **CSV**: text files with tables in Comma Separated Values format

        - **TSV**: text files with tables in Tab Separated Value format

        - **TXT**: simple text files are similar to CSV with one column and no header, supported for projects with one source only


        Update this example to specify your authorization token, Label Studio instance host, and file name and path,

        then run the following from the command line:


        ```bash

        curl -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' \

        -X POST 'https://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/import' -F ‘file=@path/to/my_file.csv’

        ```


        #### 3\. **POST with URL**

        You can also provide a URL to a file with labeling tasks. Supported file formats are the same as in option 2.


        ```bash

        curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' \

        -X POST 'https://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/import' \

        --data '[{"url": "http://example.com/test1.csv"}, {"url": "http://example.com/test2.csv"}]'

        ```

        <Note>If you have a large project it's recommended to use export snapshots, this easy export endpoint might have timeouts.</Note>

        Export annotated tasks as a file in a specific format.

        For example, to export JSON annotations for a project to a file called `annotations.json`,

        run the following from the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET https://localhost:8080/api/projects/{id}/export?exportType=JSON -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' --output 'annotations.json'

        ```

        To export all tasks, including skipped tasks and others without annotations, run the following from the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET https://localhost:8080/api/projects/{id}/export?exportType=JSON&download_all_tasks=true -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' --output 'annotations.json'

        ```

        To export specific tasks with IDs of 123 and 345, run the following from the command line:

        ```bash

        curl -X GET https://localhost:8080/api/projects/{id}/export?ids[]=123\&ids[]=345 -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' --output 'annotations.json'

        ```

      summary: Create new export snapshot
      description: >

        Create a new export request to start a background task and generate an export file (snapshot) for a specific project by ID. The project ID can be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can retrieve all project IDs using [List all projects](../list). 

        
        A snapshot is a static export of your project's data and annotations at a specific point in time. It captures the current state of your tasks, annotations, and other relevant data, allowing you to download and review them later. Snapshots are particularly useful for large projects as they help avoid timeouts during export operations by processing the data asynchronously.


        For more information, see the [Label Studio documentation on exporting annotations](https://labelstud.io/guide/export.html).

        You will need to provide the project ID and export ID (`export_pk`). The export ID is returned when you create the export. 


        The project ID can be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can retrieve all project IDs using [List all projects](../list).
