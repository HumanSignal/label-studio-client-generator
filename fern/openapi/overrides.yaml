        A snapshot is a static export of your project's data and annotations at a specific point in time. It captures the current state of your tasks, annotations, and other relevant data, allowing you to download and review them later. Snapshots are particularly useful for large projects as they help avoid timeouts during export operations by processing the data asynchronously.

        ML-assisted labeling with interactive pre-annotations works with image segmentation and object detection tasks using rectangles, ellipses, polygons, brush masks, and keypoints, as well as with HTML and text named entity recognition tasks. Your ML backend must support the type of labeling that you’re performing, recognize the input that you create, and be able to respond with the relevant output for a prediction. For more information, see [Interactive pre-annotations](https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html#Interactive-pre-annotations).


        Before you can use interactive annotations, it must be enabled for you ML backend connection (`"is_interactive": true`). 

        
        You will need the task ID and the ML backend connection ID. The task ID is available from the Label Studio URL when viewing the task, or you can retrieve it programmatically with [Get task list](../tasks/list). The ML backend connection ID is available via [List ML backends](list).

        <Note>The terms "predictions" and pre-annotations" are used interchangeably.</Note>


        Predictions can be [imported directly into Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/guide/predictions) or [generated by a connected ML backend](https://labelstud.io/guide/ml.html#Pre-annotations-predictions). 
        
        
        To import predictions via the API, see [Create prediction](create).
    post:
      summary: Create prediction
      description: >

        If you have predictions generated for your dataset from a model, either as pre-annotated tasks or pre-labeled tasks, you can import the predictions with your dataset into Label Studio for review and correction.


        To import predicted labels into Label Studio, you must use the [Basic Label Studio JSON format](https://labelstud.io/guide/tasks#Basic-Label-Studio-JSON-format) and set up your tasks with the predictions JSON key. The Label Studio ML backend also outputs tasks in this format. 


        #### JSON format for predictions
        
        Label Studio JSON format for pre-annotations must contain two sections:
        
        * A data object which references the source of the data that the pre-annotations apply to. This can be a URL to an audio file, a pre-signed cloud storage link to an image, plain text, a reference to a CSV file stored in Label Studio, or something else. 
        
        * A predictions array that contains the pre-annotation results for the different types of labeling. See how to add results to the predictions array.

      description: >
        
        Use this API endpoint to import labeling tasks in bulk. Note that each POST request is limited at 250K tasks and 200 MB.

        The project ID can be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can retrieve all project IDs using [List all projects](../projects/list). 


        <Note>
        
        Imported data is verified against a project *label_config* and must include all variables that were used in the *label_config*. 
        
        
        For example, if the label configuration has a *$text* variable, then each item in a data object must include a `text` field.

        </Note>


        There are three possible ways to import tasks with this endpoint:


        #### 1\. **POST with data**

        Send JSON tasks as POST data. Only JSON is supported for POSTing files directly.


        Update this example to specify your authorization token and Label Studio instance host, then run the following from

        the command line:


        ```bash

        curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' \

        -X POST 'https://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/import' --data '[{"text": "Some text 1"}, {"text": "Some text 2"}]'

        ```


        #### 2\. **POST with files**

        Send tasks as files. You can attach multiple files with different names.


        - **JSON**: text files in JavaScript object notation format

        - **CSV**: text files with tables in Comma Separated Values format

        - **TSV**: text files with tables in Tab Separated Value format

        - **TXT**: simple text files are similar to CSV with one column and no header, supported for projects with one source only


        Update this example to specify your authorization token, Label Studio instance host, and file name and path,

        then run the following from the command line:


        ```bash

        curl -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' \

        -X POST 'https://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/import' -F ‘file=@path/to/my_file.csv’

        ```


        #### 3\. **POST with URL**

        You can also provide a URL to a file with labeling tasks. Supported file formats are the same as in option 2.


        ```bash

        curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Token abc123' \

        -X POST 'https://localhost:8080/api/projects/1/import' \

        --data '[{"url": "http://example.com/test1.csv"}, {"url": "http://example.com/test2.csv"}]'

        ```

      description: >
      
        Get information about an async project import operation. This can be especially useful to monitor status, as large import jobs can take time. 


        You will need the project ID and the unique ID of the import operation. 

        
        The project ID can be found in the URL when viewing the project in Label Studio, or you can retrieve all project IDs using [List all projects](../projects/list). 


        The import ID is returned as part of the response when you call [Import tasks](import-tasks).
